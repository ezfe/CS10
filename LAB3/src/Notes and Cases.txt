==Cases==

Problem : Empty File
Solution: Does not support compressing empty files

Problem : Single unique character (1 or more occurrences)
Solution: Write out the number of bits corresponding to the number of occurrences for the character, and recognize that it’s different when decompressing

Problem : Special characters that used in encoding
Solution: Repeating separators allows identifying which is which

Problem : Huge files
Solution: This isn’t actually a problem, it just takes longer

==Notes==

If you need to open the .ezip file and cannot, either rename it to a .txt file, or drag & drop it to the app you wish to open it in.

==Tests==

You can find the tests in the tests folder. With the exception of the empty_file folder, each subfolder should contain three files.

I tested the three submitted files, however per instructions I am not including them.
